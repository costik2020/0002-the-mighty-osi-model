	"para": "Since firewalls essentially filter data, the answer depends on what kind of filtering you do. \n If you filter based on IP address (for example), you can say that  your firewall is filtering at Layer 3. \n If you filter specific ports,  you can say you're filtering at Layer 4. \n If your firewall inspects  specific protocol states or data, you can say it operates at Layer 7."
